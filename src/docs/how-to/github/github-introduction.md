## Introduction to GitHub on Core Cloud
For source code management on Core Cloud we have made the decision to adopt GitHub as our primary offering. This offering comes in two flavours depending on your projects requirements.

On Core Cloud we have multiple github environments for you to use to store code and deploy based on your requirements. We generally recommend using github.com for the smoothest experience but for tenants with stricter requirements we have a self hosted Github Enterprise Server that is hosted in AWS eu-west-2 (London). Additionally this instance is not publicly accessible so a VPN or workspace must be used. For more detailed information on the differences between the instances please see the technical architecture page for Github Enterprise Server.
