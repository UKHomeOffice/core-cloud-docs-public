## Introduction to Github Actions
Github actions are the native CI/CD solution for Github.com and Github Enterprise Server (GHES). We self host runners for both Github.com and GHES on EKS. 

In the initial phases of Core Cloud tenants will be provided with their own Github actions runners that are assigned through terraform.
